Running in a Democrat stronghold, Aaron successfully forced a well entrenched 6 term incumbent to defend a seat that had gone uncontested during the previous 3 election cycles. Proving that an aggressive urban Republican candidate can shift support in a highly Democrat district, Aaron received more votes than any previous Republican candidate to run in the 48th District and was the only Republican challenger endorsed by the Washington Post over a Democrat incumbent. Aaron attended the University of Kansas (KU) were he completed a double-major in Political Science and International Affairs, graduating in 2004. In 2001, while attending KU, Aaron put his belief in patriotism to work by joining the United States Marine Corps. As a Marine, he trained as a field radio operator with the 24th Marine Regiment. After graduating college, Aaron served six years with the United States Marine Corp Reserves to include an active-duty tour in Iraq where he served in the Al-Anabar province as an Arabic linguist with the 2ND Marine Division. Following his tour in Iraq, Aaron returned to Virginia where he began his work on Capitol Hill, specializing in the issues of energy, environment, defense, veteran’s affairs and education. Forging bipartisan coalitions in a politically divided congress, Aaron effectively worked with both Democrats and Republicans to advance numerous pieces of legislation. In 2005, while also working full-time, Aaron enrolled in a graduate degree program at American University in Washington, D.C. He used the coalition-building and bipartisan cooperation experience he had gained on Capitol Hill to bring a unique perspective to his studies. In 2008, Aaron graduated from American University with Master’s Degree in U.S. Foreign Policy. He currently resides in Arlington, Virginia where he works as a Congressional Analyst for Dynetics Inc and is an active member of the Arlington Ridge Civic Association, VFW Post 3150, and the Committee for a Better Arlington.","The Leadership Institute","https://www.leadershipinstitute.org/training/contact.cfm?FacultyID=477755","","Ringel","","","State","","",""

Regardless of what you're selling, the common denominator is you need to deliver value. Listen to your client/customer, it's not about you.

But political scientist Joshua Bandoch, who received his Ph.D. at Notre Dame this year, argues that the 27-member-nation European Union is trying to form too close of a union. “This is problematic because the diverse peoples of this union are more different than their leaders seem to want to acknowledge.”

Now a post-doctoral fellow at Brown University’s Political Theory Project, Bandoch discusses the matter in a chapter entitled “On the Problem of Forming a European Spirit—Montesquieu’s De l’Esprit des lois (1748)” in the recently released Ideas of | for Europe: An Interdisciplinary Approach to European Identity.","University of Notre Dame","https://al.nd.edu/news/latest-news/political-scientist-continues-research-in-post-doc-at-brown/","","Bandoch","","","","","","true"

He eventually hired me to work for him at the House Committee on Small Business. As I’m sure some of your staff can attest, the newest staffer often gets the issue no one else wants, and so I started working on Federal procurement policy. Working on contracting, I realized I could make a difference by saving money for taxpayers, improving competition, and helping agencies deliver on their unique missions. More than twenty years later, I still find it compelling. I attended law school at the University of Virginia, earning my J.D., and returned to Washington to practice government contracts law. In 2004, I was honored to join the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) as a senior advisor for government contracts and business development and the Acting Administrator for Government Contracting. In that role, I directed a team of over 140 staff nationwide to help the agency better provide assistance to small businesses seeking Federal procurement opportunities. Our team was able to successfully reduce the cycle time for some small business certifications by 65 percent. I am proud to say that during my tenure, the SBA - for the first time in history - met its statutorily-mandated goal of awarding 23 percent of prime contracts to small businesses. In 2005, I had the privilege of joining GSA and serving as its inaugural Chief Acquisition Officer. In this role, I participated in leading the transformation of the agency’s assisted acquisition centers, as well as the consolidation of the Federal Supply Service and the Federal Technology Service. As the agency’s representative to the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council and the leader of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council, I coordinated efforts to modernize the FAR and GSA regulations to more closely reflect the Federal Government’s increasing use of service contracts, as opposed to commodity buys. Most importantly, I worked closely with the Inspector General (IG) to address contracting issues in GSA’s eleven regions, where the IG had identified problems with improper sole source contracts, misuse of small business contracts, out-of-scope orders being placed against contracts, and Anti-Deficiency Act violations. The auditors attributed their findings to an ineffective system of internal management controls and contract personnel prioritizing customer preference over proper procurement procedures. To address these issues, I worked with the GSA Commissioners and the Regional Administrators to: 1) communicate that failure to follow the law would not be tolerated; 2) identify areas where contracting specialists perceived ambiguity and provide clarity regarding expectations and policy; 3) engage in workforce training targeting identified failures or weaknesses; 4) implement an ongoing series of procurement management reviews to identify other outstanding issues; 5) realign reporting chains and performance plans to ensure that contract specialists were evaluated on the quality of their work; 6) communicate with contractors regarding the proper procedures to follow should a task order appear to exceed to scope of the contract; 7) develop the Schedules eLibrary to assist contracting officers in making scope determinations; 8) institute regular meetings with the Department of Defense (DoD) to insure that any DoD specific requirements or funding issues were appropriately addressed by GSA; and 9) engage in ongoing dialogue with the IG so that all issues could be addressed promptly, thus mitigating risk to the taxpayer. GSA continues to have regular program management reviews, engage in targeted training, and maintain many of these processes. After my time at GSA, I rejoined the private sector and gained critical experience and insight on the Federal contracting process from different perspectives – as a customer, prime contractor and subcontractor; from the civilian and defense sides; and as a lawyer representing clients seeking to navigate the Federal procurement system. These firsthand experiences have been invaluable, as they provided a holistic view of the Federal contracting process. I know the frustrations of customers seeking to contract with the Federal Government because I have been in their shoes, and if confirmed, I will continue to use that experience to improve the process. In 2011, I returned to the House Committee on Small Business, serving again under a Missouri Chairman, Congressman Sam Graves, and then Chairman Steve Chabot of Ohio. While I specialized in acquisition policy, I also worked on capital access, regulatory reform, tax, and trade issues. The Committee conducted rigorous oversight of contracting agencies, including GSA, and worked on bipartisan legislation that aimed to help small businesses seeking to compete for contracts with the Federal Government. These bipartisan reforms - many of which originated in a Republican House, but were adopted by a Democratic Senate and signed into law by then-President Obama - sought to improve opportunities for service-disabled veterans and small technology firms; minimize barriers to entry; reduce regulatory burdens on prime and subcontractors; reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in government contracting; and streamline design-build contracting. I gained further valuable experience during my time on the House Committee on Armed Services (HASC), working on acquisition issues specific to the DoD, such as challenges with commercial item contracts, auditing, service contracting, program management, acquisition workforce, and business processes at the DoD. Earlier this year, I rejoined GSA, where I analyze topics related to acquisition to provide advice to the Acting Administrator, Tim Horne. For instance, I worked with Acting Administrator Horne on the merger of the Federal Acquisition Service and the Technology Transformation Service, the implementation of the Transactional Data rule, and opportunities to improve how GSA facilitates purchases of technology.","General Services Administration","https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/congressional-testimony/nomination-of-emily-w-murphy-to-be-administrator-us-general-services-administration","","Murphy","","","","","",""

Previously, Schaefer served in the Trump Administration as Senior Counselor to the Secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In that high-level capacity, Schaefer advanced Presidential and Secretary policy priorities at the agency, including managing the development of the HHS response to the opioid abuse crisis. Schaefer is a studied expert on health care reform on both the federal and state levels. She has researched and advised on health reform, Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and prescription drugs. She is well known in Washington policy circles as a champion of patient choice and robust competition in America’s health insurance markets. Schaefer, who has served as Heritage’s director of health policy studies and joined the organization originally in 2001, also was named Preston A. Wells Jr. Fellow in Health Policy in April 2012. As deputy director in 2009, she coordinated the think tank’s related research and was the lead advocate of its stances as debate in Congress over health care reform heated up. She has made the case for consumer-based health policy solutions as a guest expert on dozens of radio and television programs. Her research and analysis have been published in newspapers and periodicals around the country, as well as in such noted policy journals as Health Affairs. She has made presentations at national, state and professional conferences. Schaefer understands the inner workings of Congress, having worked for nearly a decade as a Capitol Hill staffer. She served as legislative director to former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) when he was a representative and to Rep. Sue Myrick (R-N.C.). She began her Hill career on the staff of the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC). The Preston Wells Jr. fellowship, made possible by the Florida-based Lillian S. Wells Foundation, recognized Schaefer's leadership in opposition to what Americans now call “Obamacare” and in efforts to move America to patient-centered, market-based health care. Wells, an entrepreneur, served on Heritage’s Board of Trustees from 1994 until his death in 2003. In 2008, Schaefer won Heritage’s prestigious W. Glenn and Rita Ricardo Campbell Award in recognition of specialized but high-profile work on the uninsured and related issues, in particular the SCHIP. Each year, the award goes to a policy expert who has made “an outstanding contribution to the analysis and promotion of a Free Society.” Schaefer received a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1994. Originally from Charlotte, N.C., she currently resides in Washington, D.C., with her husband and son.","The Heritage Foundation","https://www.heritage.org/staff/nina-owcharenko-schaefer","","Schaefer","","","","","",""

Concurrently, Viana prepared and delivered general teaching skills sessions to Florida International University's undergraduate students receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in education in all levels and content areas. After acquiring his degree in educational leadership in 2006, Viana became an elementary school administrator for Durham (North Carolina) Public Schools, where he established the districtwide Title I Parent Advisement Committee for Hispanics to help ensure that Latino children from low-income families met challenging state academic standards. Viana is a second-generation Cuban immigrant who started his primary years as an English language learner. The magnificent teachers he encountered in his early learning inspired him to become an educator. Viana has devoted his life to improving educational opportunities for minority populations and is honored to serve our nation's English learners and their families. Viana and his wife, Aimee, the senior executive director for marriage and family life in the Diocese of Raleigh, North Carolina, have two children. They are expecting their third child this fall. Viana also manages to find time in the evenings to prepare high school students from China for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).","Department of Education","https://www2.ed.gov/news/staff/bios/viana.html","","Viana","","","","Jose Viana served as an administrator of the Migrant Education Program for North Carolina's Department of Public Instruction.","",""

“I learned many life lessons and began to understand healthcare in that rural ER and on the ambulance responding to houses and incidents in the county,” said Sexton.

After graduating GRHS in 2009, Sexton took his passion for healthcare to college where he worked nights at a trauma center while attending Texas A&M.

After college is when his interest in infectious diseases started growing. He went to UNT Health Science Center to become an epidemiologist. There he started seeing what an enormous impact and burden policy can have on the healthcare system.

Sexton became interested in the political side of healthcare and worked under State Representative J.D. Sheffield, a physician and now vice chair of the House Committee on Public Health. Dr. Sheffield and Sexton both had a passion for rural healthcare and together they helped foster legislation to the governor’s desk that has had a statewide impact.

Sexton gained practical experience while working with Dallas County as an infectious disease epidemiologist on high consequence infectious diseases. Sexton worked on surveillance for the Zika and West Nile diseases.

It was then that Sexton had an opportunity to work in DC for Congressman Michael Burgess. Congressman Burgess, is a chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. This office has oversight over a vast majority of the nations healthcare issues. This job has lead to where he is currently serving.

“The hardest part about taking this job was leaving Congressman Burgess’ office. He is a great man that truly cares about his constituents and has an understanding of healthcare that is known nationwide. It’s an honor to serve in the administration and the opportunity for continued impact on our nation’s healthcare system,” said Sexton.","Glen Rose Reporter","https://www.yourglenrosetx.com/news/20180910/native-son-making-his-way-through-dc","","Sexton","","","","","","true"

Wilson was born on December 30, 1960, in Keene, New Hampshire. During her junior year in Keene High School, the U.S. Air Force Academy began admitting women. Wilson, who hoped to become a pilot, like her father and grandfather, entered the academy and graduated in 1982. She earned a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University where, by 1985, she earned a master’s and a doctorate in international relations. Wilson served in the Air Force until 1989 when she joined the National Security Council staff as director for European Defense Policy and Arms Control. In 1991, she married lawyer Jay Hone, and the couple settled in New Mexico. They raised three children: Scott, Joshua, and Caitlin. Wilson then started a consulting firm and, from 1995 to 1998, served in the governor’s cabinet as secretary of the New Mexico children, youth and families department. When New Mexico’s Albuquerque Congressman Steven H. Schiff declared he would not run for re–election in the fall of 1998 because of his battle with skin cancer, Wilson resigned her cabinet post and entered the Republican primary. She won the support of Schiff and U.S. Senator Pete V. Domenici, who lent her several trusted aides and called her “the most brilliantly qualified House candidate anywhere in the country.”2 But Schiff’s death in March necessitated a June 23 special election. With Domenici’s support, Wilson became the Republican candidate for the special election, propelling her to a sizable win in the June 2 primary for the fall election against conservative state senator William F. Davis. Three weeks later, Wilson won the special election (with 45 percent of the vote) in a three–way race against millionaire Democratic state senator Phillip J. Maloof and Green Party candidate Robert L. Anderson. She was sworn into office on June 25, 1998, making her the first woman since Georgia Lusk in 1946, and the first Republican woman ever, to represent New Mexico.3 The special election was but a preview for the fall election for the full two–year term. In both races, Wilson’s slogan “fighting for our families” encompassed an agenda including better public schools, elimination of the marriage penalty, and an elimination of estate taxes. Both races were contentious and costly. For the June 23 special election Maloof spent $3.1 million and portrayed Wilson as an outsider. Leading up to the November 1998 general election, Maloof spent an additional $5 million to Wilson’s $1.1 million, making it the most expensive House race in New Mexico’s history. Wilson prevailed, with 48 percent of the vote. She won her 2000 re–election bid by a seven–point margin over her Democratic challenger. In 2002, she defeated Democrat Richard Romero with 55 percent to 45 percent of the vote. Two years later, she defeated Romero by a similar margin to earn a seat in the 109th Congress (2005–2007). In 2006, when Republicans lost the majority in the House, Wilson faced her stiffest electoral challenge, defeating Democratic candidate Patricia Madrid by 861 votes out of more than 211,000 cast.4 When Wilson took her seat in the House in 1998, she received assignments on the Commerce Committee (later renamed Energy and Commerce), including its subcommittees on Telecommunication, Energy and Air Quality, and Environment and Hazardous Materials. She remained on that panel for the duration of her House career. Wilson also won an additional seat on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. But she left that assignment in the 107th Congress (2001–2003) for a seat on the powerful Armed Services Committee. Armed Services offered her a prime vantage point from which to oversee personnel and infrastructure issues at two installations in her district: Kirtland Air Force Base and the Sandia National Lab. In the 109th Congress, Wilson left Armed Services to return to the Intelligence Committee, where she chaired the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence. Wilson’s reputation in Congress was that of a moderate Republican who was not reluctant to take positions independent of her party. She called for a simplification of the tax codes and became one of the GOP’s point persons in the House to criticize the American bombing campaign in Kosovo. But on social issues, she was more moderate than many of her GOP colleagues. She supported requiring federal workers’ health plans to cover contraceptive coverage (although she opposed using public money to pay for abortions) and also voted down an amendment that would have banned adoptions by gay parents in the District of Columbia. She also opposed a plan by the Republican leadership to move management of the nuclear weapons program (largely based in New Mexico) from the Department of Energy to the Pentagon.5 In 2006, Wilson led efforts to ensure congressional oversight of the President’s terrorist surveillance program. Wilson chose not to seek re–election to a sixth term in the House, and instead announced her intention to run in 2008 for an open U.S. Senate seat being vacated by longtime New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici. Wilson narrowly lost the Republican primary and retired from the House at the conclusion of the 110th Congress on January 3, 2009.","U.S. House of Representatives","http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/24163","","Wilson","","","","","",""

Governor Perdue immediately went to work reforming the state budget, setting priorities, and cutting wasteful spending. His efforts helped stimulate the economy and turn the state budget deficit that he inherited in to a substantial surplus. The Governor then invested in his top priorities and got results. During Perdue’s first term, Georgia created over 200,000 new jobs and posted the highest graduation rate and SAT scores in state history. After a first term marked by numerous accomplishments, Governor Perdue won re-election by an overwhelming margin in November 2006. As Georgia’s Governor, Perdue has led the state based on his life experiences prior to entering public service. Sonny was born on December 20, 1946, in Perry, Georgia, to a lifelong farmer and a classroom teacher. He graduated from Warner Robins High School and earned a doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1971 from the University of Georgia. Following his service as a Captain in the United States Air Force, Perdue became a successful small business owner, concentrating in agribusiness and transportation. Today, those businesses have grown to include several locations across the Southeast. Perdue was a respected leader in his church and his community when he decided to enter public service. After serving on the Houston County Planning and Zoning Board during the 1980’s, he ran for the Georgia State Senate in 1990 and won. Sonny spent the next 11 years representing his Middle Georgia district in the General Assembly. Perdue left the State Senate in 2001 to begin his successful campaign for Governor, which focused on restoring public trust in state government and empowering all Georgians. As a state senator, he was often praised for tackling issues when no one else had the courage to do so and for his ability to grasp the nuances of complex problems. Sonny was recognized as a leading authority on numerous issues including agriculture, transportation, education, emerging technologies and economic development. Perdue campaigned for Governor on a platform of restoring public trust in state government and empowering all Georgians by eliminating undue interference by government bureaucracies. He has dedicated his administration to attracting new businesses and jobs to Georgia, improving the quality of programs that touch the lives of children, and fighting for a comprehensive ethics reform package. For all of his success in business and public service, Governor Perdue is proudest to serve as devoted husband, loving father, and grandfather. Sonny is married to the former Mary Ruff of Atlanta, Georgia. The couple has four children and eleven grandchildren. Additionally, Sonny and Mary have served as foster parents for eight newborns awaiting adoption. The Perdue’s attend the First Baptist Church of Woodstock, where they have taught a Sunday school class for young couples emphasizing the importance of faith in building a strong and lasting marriage.","Georgia Office of the Governor via Internet Archive","https://web.archive.org/web/20180117193029/http://sonnyperdue.georgia.gov/00/channel_modifieddate/0%252C2096%252C78006749_98067483%252C00.html","","Perdue","","","","","",""

As Governor of the Lone Star State, Perry championed conservative principles that helped Texas become America’s economic engine. Under Perry’s leadership, Texas became a national leader for job creation, innovation, and population growth. Perry’s leadership of Texas proved that economic growth and protection of the environment can be achieved simultaneously. While adding population and more than 2.2 million jobs during his tenure, Texas also experienced major reductions in carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions. Despite having a rapidly growing population and one of the largest petrochemical refining industries in the world, Texas saw its air quality improve. Perry grew up the son of tenant farmers in the tiny West Texas community of Paint Creek. The younger of Ray and Amelia Perry’s two children, he was active in scouting and earned distinction as an Eagle Scout. He was one of the first in his family to go to college, earning a degree in Animal Science from Texas A&M University, where he was also a member of the Corps of Cadets and a Yell Leader.

Her work as an intern led to a job offer, and forced Vanessa to figure out creative ways to finish her degree at Oshkosh while also accepting a job that put her in the middle of the action in exciting political times. She was able to successfully juggle life in D.C., frequent trips to Wisconsin, and a pile of coursework in order to complete the requirements for graduation this summer.

More than anything, Vanessa understands the power of internships. “Internships are very beneficial to a career on the Hill,” she writes. “As an intern you have the opportunity to build relationships with staff and members of Congress, as well as get a taste for the expectations of working on the Hill. From my experiences, you can never go wrong with a positive attitude. The environment on the Hill can become very intense at times, and a positive mindset and determination to work hard can go a long way.”

Maintaining solid work relationships is critical in a job like Vanessa’s. “My daily duties include assisting office Senior Staff, creating daily schedules for the Staff Assistants and Interns, and helping with the operations side of outside groups visiting the office (located inside the Capitol building). I enjoy all aspects of my job, which I think is a symptom of working with and for really great people,” she says.

Political Science was an obvious choice for Vanessa, and she uses the skills she earned here every day. “I chose Political Science as a major because of my passion for politics and interest in the minutiae of studying law. Many of my skills obtained through my Political Science degree have extended into my current job,” she writes. And she echoes something we hear from employers a lot: critical thinking and research are not just classroom projects, but essential job skills. “First and foremost, I would say that the skill of being able to think critically has been the most significant as many of my daily duties involve quick decision-making,” Vanessa writes. “The ability to know how to conduct research has also proven itself to be invaluable, which was a skill emphasized during my time in the Political Science department at UW-Oshkosh.”

We’re thrilled that Vanessa was able to pursue this opportunity in D.C., and we are eager to learn where it takes her next. Want to know more about Vanessa’s path, working on the Hill, or living in D.C.? We have a lot of wonderful connections there, including Vanessa. Let us know how we can help you!

We have full confidence that Laurie’s depth of knowledge and experience as well as her dedication to preparing students for success will move us forward in our commitment to raise expectations and improve outcomes for infants, toddlers, children and youth with disabilities across the country.

Laurie has dedicated the past 38 years to ensuring that students with disabilities have access to a high-quality education, and her passion for empowering students to succeed began long before she entered the field. Laurie’s mom was a teacher who helped develop one of the first instructional support models for a school district in Lansing, MI, and her work ethic inspired Laurie to seek a similar career path.

“My mom was my first mentor and role model,” Laurie said. “I watched her commitment to her profession and observed her passion for meeting the individual needs of students.”

During the four years she spent earning her Bachelor of Science degree at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, MI, Laurie’s passion for meeting the needs of students with disabilities grew. After she graduated in 1976, she kicked off her career by working with high school students as a special education teacher at Wayland Union Schools.

Laurie’s experience in the field of special education expands far beyond the classroom. After teaching high schoolers and middle schoolers for 15 years, Laurie returned to Grand Valley to earn her master’s degree in special education administration, which has proven valuable in her work. She has since served as supervisor of special education for Grand Rapids Public School District, special education consultant with the Michigan Department of Corrections, and most recently as director of special education for Kent Intermediate School District. She also plays a vital role in helping special education administrators develop strong leadership competencies by teaching classes in Grand Valley’s Special Education Administration Program.","Department of Education","https://sites.ed.gov/osers/2018/10/announcing-new-osep-director/","","Vanderploeg","","","","","","true"

While in law school, Mr. Bachus earned the Somerville Prize for distinguished legal scholarship. Mr. Bachus served in the Alabama National Guard from 1969 to 1971, during the Vietnam War, while attending law school. Mr. Bachus maintained a private law practice until he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992.

Working with a strong team of committee members and his highly-respected committee staff, Mr. Bachus strove to find solutions to the critical issues facing the nation’s economy. During the depths of the crisis in Fall 2008, Mr. Bachus advocated capital injections to help stabilize the financial sector, the approach ultimately adopted by the Treasury Department.

A voice for racial understanding and reconciliation, Mr. Bachus received the Houghton-Lewis Leadership Award from the Faith and Politics Institute.

From March 2008 to August 2009, I worked for a premier West Coast law firm headquartered in Portland, Oregon, Bullivant Houser Bailey PC, where I expanded my practice to include Oregon and Washington clients. I am originally from the Pacific Northwest, so it has been wonderful being back in the Portland-Vancouver community representing clients up and down the West Coast in business, anti-discrimination, entertainment, and litigation matters. I have enjoyed working for a wide range of clients, from restaurants to medical clinics, and from authors and musicians to independent filmmakers and record labels, as well as employees, students, and citizens whose civil rights may have been violated. I also appreciate staying connected to my alma maters, Stanford University and Pepperdine University School of Law. I believe in being part of a team to help any person, business, or creative endeavor succeed, achieve dreams, correct injustices, and make the world a better place.","LinkedIn","https://www.linkedin.com/in/candiceejackson/","","Jackson","","","","Candice Jackson worked for Judicial Watch and ran her own law firm.

Currently, Dr. Schneider is a vice president and an Institute Fellow at the American Institutes for Research and President of College Measures. From 2005-2008, he served as Commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. Dr. Schneider is also a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and Distinguished Professor Emeritus of political science at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. Dr. Schneider is one of the pioneers in measuring the return on the investment that students and taxpayers make in pursuing higher education.

Among her honors, Sweeney -- a lifetime member of the National Congress of American Indians -- was crowned Miss NCAI in 1993 and traveled the country as an ambassador for the organization. In 2003, Governor Frank Murkowski recognized Sweeney’s passion for rural Alaska, appointing her to his cabinet as Special Assistant for Rural Affairs and Education. In 2008 she was honored as a “Top Forty Under 40″ business leader by the Alaska Journal of Commerce. In 2014 & 2017 her team won two Emmy® Awards from the Northwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, for its IAM IÑUPIAQ commercial campaign 2014 and its 2017 long-format documentary titled, “True North, the Story of ASRC”.

Previously, he was a legislative assistant for then-U.S. Rep. Terry Everett, R-Alabama, who served on the House Agriculture Committee. More recently, Gray was president of Gray Matter Consulting, LLC. 

“Agriculture is woven into the fabric of America’s rural communities. Providing crop insurance tools for farmers is important for them to manage and mitigate risks in farming,” said Gray, who grew up in Tallassee. “President Trump and Secretary Perdue have proven they are committed to farmers and are focused on improving services to them.”

RMA manages the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to provide crop insurance products to America’s farmers and ranchers. Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs) sell and service Federal crop insurance policies through a public-private partnership with RMA. The agency backs AIPs who share risks associated with catastrophic losses due to major weather events.

“Our agency is determined to provide better service to our customers — American farmers — and USDA is focused on how we can deliver farm programs better and more efficiently,” Gray said. “This is an exciting opportunity for me, and I am happy to serve USDA and be a part of this team.”

RMA Administrator Martin Barbre, an Illinois farmer, was appointed earlier this year and was sworn in by Perdue April 30. He is the former president of the National Corn Growers Association.

“We’re really fortunate to have Keith on board at RMA,” Barbre said. \"His extensive background in agriculture and grasp of the issues that farmers care about will help us achieve many of our goals — from expanding the farm safety net to increasing access to capital for beginning farmers.”

Federation President Jimmy Parnell congratulated Gray on his appointment.

“Keith has an excellent record of serving Alabama farmers, and we’re excited about the opportunity for him to put his knowledge and experience to work for USDA and farmers across America,” Parnell said.

Gray is a preferred trainer and chair of the Grants Management Committee of the Grant Professionals Association. He is also a trainer for the National Grants Management Association. Gray graduated from the University of Alabama with a B.A. in political science and a master’s in public administration. He also is a graduate of the George Mason School of Law in Arlington, Virginia. He is district chairman of Colonial District in northern Virginia and an executive board member of the Boy Scouts of America National Capital Area Council.

He and wife Nicole live in Alexandria, Virginia, and have two children.","Alabama Farmers Federation","http://alfafarmers.org/stories/news-detail/keith-gray-named-usda-risk-management-agency-chief-of-staff#.XFJZMPx7lp8","","Gray","","","","","","true"

Although he was inspired by his grandfather, a patrol torpedo boat commander in the Navy, he enrolled at West Point. After graduating in 1997, he served in a variety of infantry duty positions as a platoon leader based at Fort Bragg, N.C. Meanwhile, he got married and had two children.

Then came Sept. 11, 2001. “That changed everything,” he said.

Brooks served in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 and then again in 2006. When he came back the second time, he started to think about the next assignment after command.

He decided to apply for the Army fellowship in Cornyn’s office because he craved knowledge of policy, and the Texas senator’s views on the war aligned with his own.

“The senator is a steadfast supporter of the troops and the mission,” Brooks said. “He knows a precipitous withdrawal would lead to chaos in the region. He gets it.”

During his time on Capitol Hill, Brooks has been impressed with the political process. “The folks here have good intentions,” he said. “They’re trying to do the right thing.”

He remembered the first time he went to the Senate floor with Cornyn to hear him speak about staying the course in Iraq.

“That was the moment it struck me,” Brooks said. “The senator was translating the emotional investment I had in Iraq and was putting it to paper. He gave voice to my concerns.”

Still, Brooks has no plans to stay in politics once his fellowship ends.

“This experience has made me a well-rounded individual,” he said, “but my aspirations aren’t political. My passion is leading troops.”","Politico","https://www.politico.com/politicopros/colinbrooks.html","","Brooks","","","","","","true"

This exposed me to the inner workings of university governance and got me involved in such issues as academic freedom and student rights on campus. These experiences piqued my interest in the law and governance of higher education institutions, and FIRE’s resources gave me plenty of guidance during those years. I was dismayed when I looked up CSU on FIRE’s website and found a \"yellow light\" rating for its speech codes, meaning there were policies that were ambiguous and could be used to deny students their expressive rights on campus. I also found out that FIRE had come to the defense of CSU’s student newspaper when the editorial board ran a column using strong language to criticize President Bush and the university considered firing the editor responsible. This drove home for me that denials of student rights in universities were not as rare or distant as I’d always assumed.

    When I came to law school, I knew I wanted an opportunity to help defend constitutional rights on university campuses. FIRE’s Internship Program offered the perfect opportunity for this, providing first-hand experience defending these rights and advocating for recognition of the value that freedom offers to colleges and universities. I’m motivated in the work I do for FIRE not just because the law is on our side, but also because I believe that freedom in academic institutions is a core tenet of our democratic system and a touchstone of American values. I’ve seen the efforts to squash public discourse and punish protected speech in colleges and universities, and I hope my work at FIRE will help make those infringements on student rights a relic of the past. I know my education would have been less valuable without the experience of participating in rallies, protests, and demonstrations, and I would have been intellectually impoverished if my classmates with unorthodox or unpopular viewpoints had been excluded from the free exchange of ideas on campus. I hope that I can ensure the same robust and challenging intellectual atmosphere is available for all students. Though my legal education has just begun, I’ve already learned enough to recognize the unparalleled benefits offered by freedom and the dangers posed by governmental overreach.","Foundation for individual rights in Education","https://www.thefire.org/introducing-jordan-von-bokern-from-university-of-chicago-law-school/","","Bokern","","","","","","true"

He is currently pursuing an International Relations degree with a possibility of minoring in Russian Area Studies. Before transferring to the college his sophomore year he was in the United States Marine Corps. Although he originally intended to become a military police officer, he was selected for a special duty assignment working as part of the security company responsible for protection of the presidential helicopters. Throughout five years of service he had the opportunity to travel and work on five continents, be on the periphery of numerous political summits (G8, G20), and play an integral role in the conduct of presidential travel. He left the Marine Corps in 2013 with numerous awards and commendations. In the summer of 2014, he took advantage of the school’s study abroad opportunities and spent six weeks in Russia studying the Russian language intensively. He is currently interested in domestic issues concerning veterans, health policy, and debate on foreign policy in the house and senate. When he’s not facing the rigors of college life he enjoys being outdoors, exercising, jamming out to Dave Matthews Band and watching the Washington Nationals (throw away they’re opportunity at a World Series win.) He’s enthusiastically looking forward to the opportunities that await him in the nation’s capital.","William & Mary (Bio from 2015)","https://www.wm.edu/offices/dccenter/opportunities/dcsummerinstitutes/past-summers/fellows/2015-summer-fellows/ap-bios/index.php","","Abner","","","","","","true"

As publisher and CEO for these magazines, his business travels took him throughout Europe and Asia as he established networks for worldwide distribution. In addition, Mr. Lawler was a publisher for a saltwater sportfishing magazine for 15 years, and he launched a saltwater fishing trade show that is now in its tenth year. Concurrently, Mr. Lawler’s interest in agriculture led him to launch a media company that serves America’s cattle ranchers.

Mr. Lawler is a graduate of the University of Southern California with a degree in public relations from the Annenberg School of Communications and Journalism. He has served on a number of boards and is currently on the Board of Trustees at Northrise University in Zambia.","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration","https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/noaa-appoints-drew-lawler-new-deputy-assistant-secretary-international-fisheries","","Lawler","","","","","","true"

Meyer, who spent the past year working with Code for America, has accepted a role as a “technologist” in the office of Commissioner Rohit Chopra at the Federal Trade Commission. Chopra, a Democrat, is apparently the first commissioner to establish and fill this role.

Meyer’s job, it seems, will be focused on helping Chopra and team reach a deeper level of understanding of technology’s role in the various industries regulated by the FTC.

“It’s tough for government to hold industries accountable without understanding how they truly work,” Chopra tweeted, by way of announcing the hire. “That’s why I’m thrilled that Erie Meyer has joined the FTC as my office’s Technologist.”

Chopra is brand new to the FTC himself — he was sworn in at the beginning of May. Earlier in his career Chopra helped found the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau after the enactment of the Dodd Frank Act, and served as the bureau’s assistant director. He also served as a special adviser to the secretary of Education during the Obama administration. Throughout his career, Chopra has focused on the student loan market, and helping to develop new tools for student loan borrowers.

Meyer also has a background at CFPB. She got her start in government on the bureau’s Tech + Innovation Team before becoming a senior adviser to then-U.S. CTO Todd Park in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. After that, Meyer went on to co-found USDS.","FedScoop.com","https://www.fedscoop.com/erie-meyer-technologist-ftc/","","Meyer","","","","","","true"

Rivera, serves as the State Executive Director of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development (RD) in Puerto Rico, since April 2018.

     He started his career while he was in college when he interned and worked full time in one of the Puerto Rico’s top 10 accounting firms, Falcón Sánchez & Associates, as well as in the globally renowned PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP. (PwC), Assurance Practices.

     His inspiration to enter public service and policy-making began when, as participant of the Baltasar Corrada del Rio Summer Internship of the Puerto Rico Department of State, he had the opportunity to rotate in the department’s offices of the Deputy Secretary of Corporate Services, Secretary of State and the Governor’s Office.

     In 2010, he was awarded a full scholarship to represent Puerto Rico in the World Affairs Council of America annual conference “US Foreign Policy: Into the Next Decade” in Washington, D.C. His commitment to serve his community has earned him awards by multiple non-profit organizations like the congressionally-chartered U.S. Civil Air Patrol and the National Exchange Club of San Juan.

     He was Secretary of the Board of Directors of the Association of Latino Professionals for America, Puerto Rico Chapter.

Under the direction of Secretary Sonny Perdue, the USDA will always be facts-based and data-driven, with a decision-making mindset that is customer-focused. Secretary Perdue leads the USDA with four guiding principles: to maximize the ability of American agriculture to create jobs, sell foods and fiber, and feed and clothe the world; to prioritize customer service for the taxpayers; to ensure that our food supply is safe and secure; and to maintain good stewardship of the natural resources that provide us with our miraculous bounty. And understanding that we live in a global economy where trade is of top importance, Secretary Perdue has pledged to be an unapologetic advocate for American agriculture.

As State Executive Director, Hampy will use his leadership experience and knowledge of federal farm program legislation to oversee FSA programs in a customer-focused manner to ensure a safe, affordable, abundant and nutritious food supply for consumers.","Farm Service Agency","https://www.fsa.usda.gov/state-offices/Missouri/news-releases/2018/MO_SED_Brent_Hampy","","Hampy","","","","","","true"

During my tenure at DOJ, I won numerous cases on merits briefing, litigating every aspect of the National Environmental Policy Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and National Forest Management Act, under the Administrative Procedure Act. I handled a variety of extractive mineral issues, including significant cases involving leasing decisions (onshore and offshore), mine plan approvals, applications for permits to drill, land exchanges, enforcement decisions, and royalty decisions. I also served as the Natural Resources Section’s sole resource for bankruptcy issues, which included significant participation in cases involving the nation’s largest coal companies, giving me additional experience with the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, under the statute’s self-bonding provisions. I was also the lead attorney on numerous cases involving Section 4(f), and gained trial experience with Indian trust issues that presented a range of unique natural resource issues; the Quiet Title Act; and Fifth Amendment takings. I also defended a number of species-related issues.
